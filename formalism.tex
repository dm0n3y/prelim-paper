\note{think about name of calculus as opposed to implementation}

\subsection{Tiles}

% \input{tiles-syntax}

\subsection{Frames}

\subsection{Edit States}
% \input{token-syntax}

\subsubsection{Actions}
\note{
  Define actions more generally than \tylr~ implementation,
  such that delimiters are assigned sorts to their ends,
  selections are not restricted to shards and
  same-sort tiles, and only selections whose ends are the
  same may enter restructuring mode.

% (2 * [3])  ->  (2 * (3 + [_]))

\begin{itemize}
  \item explain action judgment + choice rules
  \item theorems
  \begin{itemize}
    \item movability
    \item selectability
    \item restructuring is sound and complete
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typechecking}
\note{
  Define tree-structured variants of tiles and frames.
  Define precedence parser that converts linear forms to tree forms
  (or assume existence of such parser?).
  Define type
