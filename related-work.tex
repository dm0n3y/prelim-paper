    \item Design Requirements for More Flexible Structured Editors from a Study of Programmers' Text Editing
      by Amy Ko \& Brad Myers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item list edits (23\%):
          removing a list element and its delimiter (8\%);
          moving the right list delimiter(3\%);
          ``flattening'' a list inside of a list (2\%)
        \item infix expressions (15\%):
            replacing the infix expression with its left (8\%) or right (1\%) operand;
            ``wrapping'' a left or right operand (4\%);
            unwrapping a left or right operand (2\%)
        \item prefix expressions (1\%):
            applying a prefix operator to an expression (81\%);
            ``unwrapping'' a prefix operand (11\%)
        \item that amounts to 6\% of edits clearly involving selecting and
          moving/removing non-term selections, or 10\% of edits not involving
          modifying names
