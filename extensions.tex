\section{Extensions \& Limitations}

\tylr~ is a minimal demonstration of tile-based
editing, optimized for exposition rather than practical use,
while \ty~ formalizes an essential subset of \tylr's functionality.
In this section, we will sketch how \ty~ may be extended
in simple ways to support \tylr's full feature set,
then discuss our ongoing efforts to scale up tile-based
editing to support larger-scale program authoring.

\note{talk about evaluation plans}

\begin{itemize}
\item pilot study of earlier ad hoc design, Hazel implementation in progress for user study of latest design
\item parsed structure should be maintained with edit state
\item dealing with text literals
\item empty delimiters
\item sequences eg blocks of statements
\item automatic selection and restructuring
\item rematching delimiters
\item shared delimiters (eg parenthesized vs fn tight ap)
\item 2d layout
\item free floating comments
\end{itemize}
