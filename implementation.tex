\section{Design \& Implementation of \tylr}\label{sec:implementation}

\note{
  Talk about \texttt{tylr} design/implementation choices that deviate
  from and apply restrictions to formalism.
  Avoid major screenshots, show these instead in Section 2.
  See if it's possible to avoid Design in section title.

\begin{itemize}
  \item showing tree structure in pointing mode
  \begin{itemize}
    \item parsing as you go
  \end{itemize}
  \item no sort dependency cycle
  \begin{itemize}
    \item greedy selection
    \item tile design: same-sort vs diff-sort children
  \end{itemize}
  \item picking up multiple matching selections in restructuring mode
  \begin{itemize}
    \item copy and pasting of root nodes rather than whole terms
    \item just as a whole selection can be moved anywhere, matching selections
      can be moved anywhere as a group
  \end{itemize}
  \item enabling restructuring across sorts by unsorting selections
  \item entering restructuring mode automatically on deletion/construction
\end{itemize}
