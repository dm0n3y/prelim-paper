We now present an example-driven overview of tile-based
editing as implemented in \tylr.

\note{consider a parens teaser example in the intro}

\note{consider having some explanation why I'm not starting from hole}
\note{maybe just edit the following sentence so I'm editing given function, not defining afresh}

\note{try splitting section into subsections by features}

\note{make clear the invariant of syntactic sensibility at the start, use it as a guide}

Suppose you are using \tylr~ to define a function that gets called by a
generative drawing application \note{cite Sketch n Sketch}.
\note{use word ``exploratory here''}
The function should take an integer index and
return a circle---represented as a pair comprising
its center coordinates and radius---to be drawn in
the $xy$-plane for every index.
Its default implementation, shown below, draws circles
of radius \texttt{1} along the line $y = x$.
Panning the cursor over the expression shows you terms of
the abstract syntax of \tylr, the relevant subset of which
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:language-syntax}.
\note{consider talking adding bin holes to abstract syntax}
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{|$\lambda$ n . ( n , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$|n . ( n , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n|. ( n , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n .|( n , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . (|n , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . ( n|, n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . ( n ,|n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . ( n , n|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . ( n , n )|, 1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . ( n , n ) ,|1} \\
  & \texttt{\ $\lambda$ n . ( n , n ) , 1|}
\end{align*}
% You observe that \tylr~ features left-associative binary
% products rather than n-tuples, meaning the default function
% has the expected return type despite the lack of parentheses.

Highlighted at the root of every term is a structure called
a \emph{tile}.
\note{say more about tiles, color-coded by sort, shaped at ends
to form operator sequences, how they encompass all delimiters
of a given term, something about tile syntax only preserving
bidelimited children, reference figure with syntax}
Holding Alt/Option at any time reveals the local tile sequence
housing the cursor.

\note{add figure of panning cursor over same program but with tile view on}

Where other structure editors model their edit states
using the term syntax, \tylr~ instead models its edit state
using the parallel tile syntax, parsing the tile structure
as needed to produce the term structure.
Indeed, the apparent term structure shown in Figure ?? is simply a
decoration overlaid atop the actual tile structure shown in
Figure ??.

By having the programmer edit the tile structure, and only
indirectly propagate those edits to the term structure,
\tylr~ recovers many of the flexible editing affordances to
which we are accustomed in text editors.
For example, suppose you decide to update the function to
draw circles along the line $y = 2x + 1$, which you
could accomplish in \tylr~ with the following edit sequence:
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n *|\_ ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n * 2|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n * 2 +|\_ ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n * 2 + 1|) , 1}
\end{align*}
You were able to construct the operator sequence \texttt{n * 2 + 1}
left-to-right, as you might in a text editor, without any
required consideration for its tree structure.
Such an affordance is not trivial
in traditional structure editors because,
from the perspective of the AST, linear construction of
operator sequences is a complex, context-sensitive operation.
Existing structure editors either embrace strictly tree-based
construction of operator sequences;
defer to text at the expression level,
recovering linearity at the cost of structure;
or solve the problem at the cost of complexity
(e.g. side transforms in MPS).
Tiles enable linear editing of operator sequences,
while continuously maintaining structure and
relying on simple precedence parsing
to update the operator sequence's associative structure
as you type.
\note{figure out way to say wholesale but not being whole program}
\note{insert a comment somewhere about no performance claims}
\note{review side transforms and make sure I'm not BSing}


\note{figure out where to talk about hole insertion based on tips
somewhere here}

% \tylr~ takes a different approach to this problem.
% Where traditional structure editors simply expose editing
% operations acting directly on the abstract syntactic struture
% of a program, \tylr~ presents the program in a separate
% concrete syntax with its own syntax-directed editing operations.
% \note{
%   talk about tile syntax show in Figure \ref{fig:tile-syntax},
%   note linearity
% }
% Like text, \tylr's concrete syntax gives you ``flattened''
% representation of your program that can be edited in a linear fashion.
% Unlike text, the concrete syntax maintains hierarchies of
% bidelimited children and can always be parsed into
% the abstract syntax, provided that the structure first undergoes
% a hole fixing pass in which holes are inserted and removed
% as needed. \note{need more context about tiles + bidelimited, bring
% back some old words about abstract syntactic structural units
% as opposed to concrete syntactic structural units}

% \note{perhaps go back to editor syntax terminology}

Tiles not only simplify linear \emph{insertion} in a structured
context but also enable text-like \emph{selection}
and \emph{restructuring} (e.g. cut and paste) of existing code.
While the former problem is relatively well-studied
\note{cite MPS, modeless structure editing},
almost no attention has been paid to the latter;
in particular, all prior structure editors restrict
structured selections to complete abstract syntactic terms,
a severe limitation compared to the arbitrary range
selections of text editors.
\tylr~ recovers much of this flexibility, supporting
arbitrary range selections up to token boundaries.
% Within the linearized concrete syntax, it is possible to
% select and manipulate sub- and cross-tree portions of the program,
% much like in a text editor.
For example, suppose you update your circle drawing
to its transposition, i.e., draw the circles along
the line $x = 2y + 1$.
You hold Shift and move the cursor to enter \emph{selecting mode}:
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n * 2 + 1|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n * 2 +|1|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n * 2|+ 1|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n *|2 + 1|) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n|* 2 + 1|) , 1}
\end{align*}
Such a selection is impossible in prior designs.

Having made this selection, you may then pick it up
into your \emph{backpack} to enter \emph{restructuring mode}.
Moving left to the $x$-coordinate and putting down
your backpack's contents completes the desired transformation.
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n , n[* 2 + 1]) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n ,[* 2 + 1]n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n[* 2 + 1], n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . ( n|* 2 + 1 , n ) , 1}
\end{align*}
Your backpack is a visible, structure-aware clipboard
accompanying your cursor.
\note{compare to cut and paste more broadly here to tie up}

\note{consider adding example of parenthesizing first pair, discussing
restructuring mode... or maybe find an example for precedence issue}

\note{add example parenthesizing x , y pattern}

You decide now to see what happens when you let the
radius depend on the origin coordinates.
Your plan is to bind the coordinates to variables
\texttt{x} and \texttt{y} and have the radius be their product.
You begin by constructing a let expression at the start
of the function body and constructing the pattern variables.
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n .|( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let|\_ = \_ in ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x|= \_ in ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x ,|\_ = \_ in ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y|= \_ in ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1}
\end{align*}
Now you wish to bind \texttt{x , y} to the coordinates
\texttt{n * 2 + 1 , n} already in the body.
One way you could do this is by selecting and moving
\texttt{n * 2 + 1 , n} into the defining expression of
the \texttt{let} expression.
Alternatively, you could select the \texttt{in} delimiter
of the \texttt{let} expression and move it to wrap
\texttt{n * 2 + 1 , n}.
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ in|( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_|in|( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = [in]( n * 2 + 1 , n ) , 1} \\
  % & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ n[in]* 2 + 1 , n , 1} \\
  % & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ n *[in]2 + 1 , n , 1} \\
  % & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ n * 2[in]+ 1 , n , 1} \\
  % & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ n * 2 +[in]1 , n , 1} \\
  % & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ n * 2 + 1[in], n , 1} \\
  % & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = \_ n * 2 + 1 ,[in]n , 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n )[in], 1} \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n )|in \_ , 1}
\end{align*}
\note{
  take a step back here and note that selections are not restricted
  to whole tiles but can decompose tiles into shards,
  the general idea being that selections with same-sort ends are
  the ones that can be moved around
}

\note{talk about restructuring on construction}
\begin{align*}
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) in|x , y , x * y } \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) in ([)]x , y , x * y } \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) in ( x[)], y , x * y } \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) in ( x ,[)]y , x * y } \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) in ( x , y[)], x * y } \\
  & \texttt{$\lambda$ n . let x , y = ( n * 2 + 1 , n ) in ( x , y|) , x * y }
\end{align*}

You decide now that you liked the last drawing better
and aim to undo your recent changes
You being by deleting the \texttt{let} expression.

% \subsection{\note{everything below this is old overview}}

% Tile-based structure editing departs from traditional
% structure editors in avoiding direct user modifications
% to the AST.
% Instead, much like with a text editor, the user modifies a separate
% ``flattened'' editing structure that affords more flexible
% editing mechanisms, which is subsequently parsed into the
% abstract syntax.
% Unlike a text editor, however, a tile-based editor ensures
% that every edit state can be parsed successfully.

% In this section we motivate and give an example-driven
% overview of tile-based editing as implemented
% in \tylr. We begin by describing the limitations of
% traditional structure editors, then show how tile-based
% editing overcomes these limitations.

% \subsection{A typical structure editor} \label{sec:simple-editor}

% Structure editors, also known as projectional editors, typically
% follow a projectional architecture: the editor projects an
% abstract syntax tree into a concrete representation,
% and user interactions with the representation are interpreted
% by the editor as direct modifications to the AST.

% For example, suppose we wish to edit expressions with the abstract
% syntax presented in Figure \ref{fig:tile-syntax}.
% A simple editor might project the current expression
% to a textual notation decorated with nested boxes, such
% that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
% boxes and terms. \note{example}
% In this editor, the cursor selects a subterm of the
% current program expression and may be moved through
% the current expression via a pre-order traversal.
% Edits are context-free transformations
% of the selected subterm:
%   deletion replaces the current subterm with
%     a hole of the same sort; and
%   construction replaces the current subterm
%     with the new form, making the original subterm
%     a child of the new form if possible, and moving
%     the cursor to the next child position if available.

% While simple, this editor is representative of existing structure
% editors in the way that it restricts editing affordances to easily
% understood tree manipulations of the abstract syntax.
% We believe such restrictions unacceptably hamper usability.
% Consider the following classes of edits that we may wish to
% perform---and could perform in a text editor---but cannot with the
% given interface:

% \paragraph{Linearly constructing operator sequences}
% In a text editor, we may type the characters \texttt{2}, \texttt{*},
% \texttt{3}, \texttt{+}, \texttt{4}
% to construct the expression \texttt{2 * 3 + 4} with
% the usual precedence-based operator associations.
% In our simple structure editor, the same inputs would construct
% the following series of edit states: \note{todo figure}.
% To get the associations we want, we would need to interleave
% our constructions with movements through the expression tree
% to ensure that the correct child is chosen before constructing
% the plus node: \note{todo figure}.
% This particular limitation of structure editing is well-recognized
% in prior work, which we discuss in greater detail in Section
% \ref{sec:related-work}.

% \paragraph{Preserving children of deleted terms}
% Deletion in our simple editor is quite coarse, deleting whole
% trees rather than individual nodes.


% \begin{itemize}
% \item
%   we now describe a few classes of edits that we may wish to perform---and
%   could perform in a text editor---but cannot with the given structured
%   interface
% \item structure-oblivious linear construction of operator sequences
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item eg going from \texttt{2 * 3 + 4} as opposed to \texttt{2 * (3 + 4)}
%     \item this particular limitation of naive structure editing has received
%       the most attention in prior work
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item some structure editors defer to text at the leaves
%       \item others develop more sophisticated methods, e.g.,
%         modeless structure editing article,
%         MPS's side transforms
%     \end{itemize}
%   \end{itemize}
% \item deleting the root of a term,
%   leaving behind its children for further processing
%   (eg splicing into the surrounding context)
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item eg it is not possible to delete a let expression and leave behind its body
%     \item eg it is not possible to remove a conditional expression
%       and leave behind a branch to take its place, or to subsequently join the
%       two remaining branches with an operator
%     \item note how there's no room in the strict tree structure to deal with
%       multiple "floating" children
%     \item MPS mitigates this by leaving behind its first child if its the
%       same sort, but already this does not satisfy the use case described above,
%       and in general the user should have the freedom to choose
%   \end{itemize}
% \item selecting and restructuring sub- and cross-structural
%   parts of the program
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item eg it is not possible to select \texttt{3 + 4} in \texttt{2 * 3 + 4}
%       and re-associate the expression, as one might in a text editor by
%       wrapping the selection in parentheses
%     \item eg it is not possible to select \texttt{let x = \_ in} and
%       move it before \texttt{let y = 2 in}
%     \item eg it is not possible to select \texttt{in} of \texttt{let x = \_ in}
%       and move it to wrap the subsequent portion of the expression
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item as one might in a text editor by deleting \texttt{in},
%         moving the caret, re-typing it elsewhere
%       \item as one might when constructing the let line for the first time:
%         having typed out \texttt{let x =}, it remains to move the caret over
%         and type the \texttt{in}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item while some of these examples are contrived given the simplicity of
%       the language, such selections and edits occur frequently in practice
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item eg 6\% of logged edits in Design Requirements
%         paper involve making
%         selections across structural boundaries, 10\% of edits excluding those
%         that only involve name changes rather than structural changes
%     \end{itemize}
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{\tylr: a tile-based editor}

% We now describe the design of \tylr, a tile-based structure
% editor.
% Given the disadvantages of operating directly on abstract syntax
% trees, \tylr~ presents programs to the user in a separate
% concrete syntax equipped with its own syntax-directed editing
% mechanisms.
% The concrete syntax is a ``flattened'' version of the abstract
% syntax, where the structural units correspond not to semantic
% terms of the language but rather syntactic groups of matching
% delimiters and their bidelimited children.
% We call these structural units \emph{tiles}.
% Figure \ref{fig:tile-syntax} shows the subset of \tylr's
% concrete syntax corresponding to the abstract syntax in
% Figure \ref{fig:language-syntax}.

% Unlike terms of the abstract syntax, tiles can be arranged
% sequentially.
% The cursor resides between consecutive pairs of
% tiles (or between a tile and its parent container),
% much as a text cursor resides between characters.
% Figure \note{todo} shows the different cursor positions
% in the operator sequence \texttt{2 * 3 + 4}.

% \subsubsection{Linear construction of operator sequences}
% Figure \note{todo} shows the construction of the operator
% sequence \texttt{2 * 3 + 4}. Unlike with the simple editor described
% in Section \ref{sec:simple-editor}, it is not necessary

% Unlike terms in the abstract syntax, tiles may be arranged
% sequentially as well as hierarchically.

% Rather than manipulating structures of the language syntax,
% a tile-based structure editor works within a parallel editor syntax.
% The central form in the editor syntax is the unassociated operator
% sequence. Operator sequence elements each take one of four shapes---operand,
% unary prefix, unary postfix, and
% binary infix---which we collectively refer to as \emph{tiles}.
% Tiles may in turn contain nested operator sequences.

% Like text, the editor syntax provides a flattened, more linear representation
% of the language syntax.
% Unlike text, the editor syntax maintains hierarchies of
% bidelimited children and can always be parsed into the
% language syntax, provided that the structure first undergoes
% a hole fixing pass in which holes are inserted and removed
% as needed.

% \note{talk about automatic hole fixing + operand vs operator holes}

% \note{after describing, note bonus edits that combine limitations from previous selection}

% \note{do get into how restructuring mode fits naturally within the deletion vs construction}
